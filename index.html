      <h3>My Life</h3>
      <p>I'm usually pretty private as my life has been a mix of amazing and chaotic. I fell in love with coding at a
        young age and have wanted to be a part of this world for quite some time. I truly look forward to enhancing my
        skills over time and being one of the best in my lane. I have a great family and some pretty great friends that
        I love. My dog is my best friend, him and I spend every single day together. I'm excited for this next part of
        my journey and I look forward to everything that is coming my way.</p>
      <h3>My Dog</h3>
      <p>This is Moose! One the most amazing things to happen to me in a long time. It's been through this relationship
        that I've been able to grow through reflection and resonsibility. This is the kind of relationship where if you
        want love, you're going to have to speak the other persons love language. Luckily for me his love language is
        treats and adventures. This little guy loves going for bike rides, walks on the trails, saying hi to literally
        every female he meets and playing socially with his toys. He's the best and most loving puppy ever!</p>

      <h3>My City</h3>
      <p>The city of MIami is an absolute hub of culture and social experiment. One of the most beautiful cities in my
        opinion, surrounded by a fantastic mix of jungle meets urban. Between every crack in the concrete you see the
        evidence of life breaking through, fighting to win back what once belonged. I love the people and the food, a
        mix you could easily never tire of. </p>
      <p>A city that never sleeps everything is always available and at a level of quality unheard of. With so many
        events, activites and groups to take part in, this city never has a dull moment. Miami raised me and I will
        forever love and appreciate it.</p>
