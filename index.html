      <h3>My Life</h3>
      <p>As a dedicated software engineer, I have cultivated a deep passion for coding from a young age, aspiring to continuously enhance my skills and excel in my field. I maintain a balance between my professional ambitions and personal life, cherishing the support of my wonderful family and friends. My dog, who is my constant companion, plays an integral role in my daily life. As I embark on this next chapter of my journey, I am eager to embrace the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead.</p>
      <h3>My Dog</h3>
      <p>This is Moose! One the most amazing things to happen to me in a long time. It's been through this relationship
        that I've been able to grow through reflection and resonsibility. This is the kind of relationship where if you
        want love, you're going to have to speak the other persons love language. Luckily for me his love language is
        treats and adventures. This little guy loves going for bike rides, walks on the trails, saying hi to literally
        every female he meets and playing socially with his toys. He's the best and most loving puppy ever!</p>

      <h3>My City</h3>
      <p>The city of MIami is an absolute hub of culture and social experiment. One of the most beautiful cities in my
        opinion, surrounded by a fantastic mix of jungle meets urban. Between every crack in the concrete you see the
        evidence of life breaking through, fighting to win back what once belonged. I love the people and the food, a
        mix you could easily never tire of. </p>
      <p>A city that never sleeps everything is always available and at a level of quality unheard of. With so many
        events, activites and groups to take part in, this city never has a dull moment. Miami raised me and I will
        forever love and appreciate it.</p>
